**What is automatedscreenrecorder?**

automatedscreenrecorder is an automated Java screencast video recorder for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.



**How does automatedscreenrecorder work?**

The program implements [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) for the browser automation. Browser navigation and control is handled by a locally created and saved textfile, containing its own domain-specific language.
The application also supports audio merging with [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/). Audio can either be microphone generated or text to speech based using Amazon's webservice [Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/). An additional option is to upload the screencast directly to YouTube.
