**What is automatedscreenrecorder?**

automatedscreenrecorder is an automated Java screencast video recorder for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.



**How does automatedscreenrecorder work?**

The program implements Selenium for the browser automation. Browser navigation and control is handled by a locally created and saved textfile, which is written in its own domain-specific language. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/Kaeties/automatedscreenrecorder/wiki/Run-the-application).
The application also supports audio merging. Audio can either be microphone generated or text to speech based using Amazon's webservice Polly. An additional option is to upload the screencast directly to YouTube.
