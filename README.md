# automatedscreenrecorder  
automatedscreenrecorder is an automated Java screencast video recorder for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
Navigation and application control is taken over by a locally created and saved DSL file.
The application also supports audio merging and YouTube upload.
Audio can either be microphone generated or text to speech based using Amazon's webservice Polly.
